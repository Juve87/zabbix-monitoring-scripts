# Certificate Monitoring

Discover PEM files and monitor certificates stored within.

Discovery item scans the configured path recursively for files containing PEM
formatted certificates. Directories and files that are not readable to agent
are skipped. Make sure zabbix agent user has access to monitored files.

* pyOpenSSL (17.3.0) URL: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL
* pem (17.1.0) URL: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pem
